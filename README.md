# (M)oments
## About
Moments is an application lets users find out about interesting and important dates in history.
## How It Works
A date can be either chosen at random or selected manually from the search function. It will then display data about the day, including births, deaths, and historical events. Users can then discuss selected days in the comments section.
## APIs
The program has two APIs, and internal rails-based API used to store Discussions and Comments, and an external API which parses Wikipedia's List Of Historical Anniversaries and provides JSON data.
## Levels
#### MVP
- "Shuffle" button to give a random date. Discussion and comment capabilities.
#### Bronze
- Search function allowing selection of particular date.
#### Silver  
- Drop down calendar and hiding of search bar until button press.
#### Gold
- Custom-made API which would eliminate "empty" days due to incomplete data.
