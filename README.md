Moments is an application which selects either a random date or lets the user choose a date then provides a list of historical events matching that day in history.

From there, the user can choose to either pick another date, choose one at random, or discuss the day in the comment section.

The program has two API's: and internal rails-based API and an external API which parses Wikipedia's List Of Historical Anniversaries and provides JSON data.
